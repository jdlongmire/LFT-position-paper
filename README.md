# Logic Field Theory (LFT) Position Paper

Logic Field Theory (LFT), a position paper, proposes deriving quantum mechanics from classical logic via Ω = L(S). It tackles measurement, non-locality, & Wigner's puzzle with conjectures on Hilbert space, dynamics, & pilot-wave ontology, tested in ℂ^4. A γ < 4×10^-17 m bound & 1 ppm muonic hydrogen test aim for falsification by Q2 2028. Code included.

## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source, compiled PDF, and Python verification code for the Logic Field Theory (LFT) position paper, titled "Logic Field Theory: A Foundational Program." LFT posits that quantum mechanics emerges from classical logic’s three laws (identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle) through the construction Ω = L(S), where S is all information configurations and L enforces logical consistency. The paper addresses foundational quantum puzzles—measurement, non-locality [Bell, 1964], and Wigner’s effectiveness [Wigner, 1960]—via conjectures on Hilbert space uniqueness, unitary dynamics, and pilot-wave ontology. A finite ℂ^4 model verifies these conjectures, and a muonic hydrogen test (1 ppm, targeting γ > 10^-20 m) offers falsification by Q2 2028. The Python code in Appendix F validates lattice properties and the Born rule.

## Acknowledgements

This work would not have been possible without extensive AI‐assisted drafting, verification, and structuring.  As a pure theorist and Senior Systems Architect, I relied on the combined strengths of multiple large‐language models to:

- **Draft and refine the manuscript structure** using **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) – see https://chatgpt.com/share/686fe9c3-eb50-8005-8459-ae1c7af41f66  
- **Refine drafts, verify code snippets, and structure proofs** with **Grok** (xAI) – see https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_bab69024-98a2-4726-906e-cd28bcd82fae  
- **Polish technical language and citations** via **Claude** (Anthropic)  
- **Diagram and layout suggestions** from **Gemini** (Google)

No single human could have integrated all of these pieces in the time frame—deep thanks to these AI collaborators for making it happen.




## Installation

To compile the LaTeX document and run the Python code, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

### LaTeX
- **TeX Live** or **MiKTeX** with `revtex4-2`, `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `booktabs`, `hyperref`, `graphicx`, `natbib`, `tikz`, and `pgfplots` packages.
- Install TeX Live: `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` (Ubuntu) or download from [tug.org/texlive](https://tug.org/texlive).
- For MiKTeX, use the package manager to install `pgfplots`.

### Python
- **Python 3.8+** with `numpy` and `jupyter`.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy jupyter

Usage
Compiling the LaTeX Document

Navigate to the repository directory:cd /path/to/LFT-position-paper/lft_verification.ipynb


Compile the LaTeX file using latexmk:latexmk -pdf logic_field_theory.tex

This generates logic_field_theory.pdf, identical to Logic_Field_Theory_Position_Paper_v7.0.pdf.

Running the Verification Code

Launch Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook lft_verification.ipynb


Execute the notebook cells to verify:
Non-distributivity: Checks lattice failure in ℂ^4.
Orthomodularity: Tests 1,000 random cases.
Born Rule: Computes probabilities for a toy state.



The notebook outputs confirm the lattice properties and Born rule consistency, as detailed in Appendix F of the paper.
